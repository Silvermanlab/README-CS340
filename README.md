# README-CS340
Overview and Motivation

#The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard is an interactive web application developed for CS-340 Project Two. The purpose of this application is to support animal rescue operations by analyzing and visualizing data from the Austin Animal Center Outcomes dataset. The dashboard allows users to identify dogs that are suitable for different types of search-and-rescue training based on characteristics such as age, breed, and outcome information. The project was designed to provide a user-friendly interface that reduces user error while allowing efficient access to shelter data.

#Required Functionality

#The dashboard was developed to include several required features. Users are able to filter the dataset by rescue operation type, including Water Rescue, Mountain or Wilderness Rescue, Disaster or Individual Tracking, and a Reset option that displays all available data. The data table presents detailed animal records and updates dynamically whenever a filter is applied. A geolocation map displays the geographic locations of animals using latitude and longitude data, helping users visualize where potential rescue animals are located. In addition, a secondary chart presents information such as breed distribution and automatically updates in response to the selected filters. The dashboard also includes the Grazioso Salvare logo and a unique identifier containing the developer’s name, as required by the project specifications.

#Tools and Technologies

#MongoDB was selected as the database for this project because of its flexibility and ability to efficiently store and query semi-structured data. Its document-oriented design makes it well suited for the varied fields found in animal shelter records. MongoDB integrates effectively with Python through the PyMongo library, allowing fast data retrieval and manipulation. Python was used as the primary programming language due to its strong support for database integration, data analysis, and web application development. The Dash framework was used to build the web application interface, providing both the view and controller layers of the MVC design pattern. Dash’s callback system enables dynamic updates to dashboard components without requiring direct HTML or JavaScript coding. Plotly was used to generate interactive charts, and Pandas was used to structure and manage data returned from MongoDB.

#Project Reproduction Steps

#To reproduce the project, MongoDB must first be installed and running, and the Austin Animal Center Outcomes dataset must be imported into a MongoDB collection. The CRUD Python module created in Project One must be placed in the same directory as the dashboard notebook. Required Python libraries, including Dash, Pandas, Plotly, Dash Leaflet, and PyMongo, must then be installed. After these dependencies are set up, the ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb file can be opened and executed. Once the application is running, the dashboard can be accessed through the local URL generated by the Dash server.

#Challenges and Solutions

#One of the main challenges encountered during development was difficulty launching and testing the dashboard due to syntax errors, layout issues, and configuration problems related to MongoDB queries and Dash callbacks. These issues initially prevented the dashboard from running correctly and limited the ability to test interactive components. To resolve this, the project was rebuilt incrementally by correcting layout structure, simplifying callback logic, and ensuring proper integration with the MongoDB database through the CRUD module. After reworking the code and testing each component individually, the dashboard successfully launched and all required functionality, including filtering, data visualization, and geolocation mapping, operated as intended.
