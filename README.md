CS-340 Project Two
#Overview/Motivation
The animal shelter project for Grazioso Salvare is an interactive web application designed to assist in animal rescue operations by utilizing the Austin Animal Center Outcomes dataset. The dashboard was intended to enable users to filter data according to specific rescue operation types and visualize this data through interactive components such as maps, charts, and tables.
#Required Functionality
The dashboard was designed to include several key functionalities. Users would be able to filter the dataset by rescue operation types, including Water Rescue, Mountain/Wilderness Rescue, Disaster Rescue and Individual Tracking, or reset the filter to display all data. The Data Table was intended to display detailed animal information and dynamically update based on the applied filters. A geolocation chart would visualize the locations of animal rescues on a map, aiding in planning and analysis of rescue operations. Additionally, a bar chart would provide insights into the data, such as the breed quantity of rescued animals, and dynamically respond to the applied filters.
#Tools and Technologies
MongoDB was chosen as the database due to its flexibility and scalability in handling unstructured data. Its document-oriented model is particularly well-suited for storing the varied data of animal rescue operations. MongoDB's compatibility with Python through the Pymongo library simplifies data manipulation and retrieval, enabling efficient processing for the dashboard. The Dash framework was selected for its potential to develop an interactive web application purely in Python, without the need for direct HTML or JavaScript coding. Dash's components and callback system serve as the view and controller layers, respectively, managing user interactions and dynamic content rendering.
#Project Reproduction Steps
To reproduce the project, first install MongoDB and import the Austin Animal Center Outcomes dataset into a collection. Next, install the required Python libraries using pip, including dash, pandas, plotly, and pymongo. Then, I attempt to run the Python script containing the dashboard code, ensuring MongoDB is running and accessible. Finally, open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the script to access the dashboard.
#Challenges
A major challenge encountered during development was that the dashboard could not be successfully downloaded or run. Despite setting up MongoDB, the CRUD module, and the Dash application, the dashboard failed to launch properly. This prevented the full testing of interactive components such as filters, maps, and charts. The issues appear to be related to configuration, network, or compatibility errors that could not be resolved within the scope of the project.
